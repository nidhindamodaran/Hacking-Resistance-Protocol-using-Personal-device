                        <b>Users  passwords</b>  are  prone  to  be  stolen  and 
                        com promised  under  different  <b> threats </b>  and  vulnerabilities. 
                        Firstly,  users  often  select  weak  passwords  and  reuse  the 
                        same  passwords  across  diff erent  websites.  An  adversary 
                        can  launch  several  password  stealing  attacks  to  snatch 
                        passwords,  such as  phishing,  key loggers  and malware.  In this 
                        pa per,  we  design  a  hacking  resistance  protocol for  system 
                        access (login) and other applications  requiring  authentication 
                        that  is  secure  against  passive  attacks  based  on  re playing 
                        ca ptured  reusable  passwords.  <b>The 
                            authentication  system  described  in  this  document  uses  a 
                            secret  pass- phrase  to  generate  a  sequence  of  one-time 
                            passwords.</b>  With  this  system,  the  user's  secret pass- phrase 
                        never  needs to  cross the  network at  any time  such  as during 
                        authentication  or  during  pass- phrase  changes.  Thus,  it  is 
                        not  vulnerable to re play attacks.  Added security is  provided 
                        by the  property that  no secret information  need be stored on 
                        any system,  including  the server  being protected  The security 
                        of  the  system  is  based  on  the  non-invert  ability  of  a  secure 
                        hash  function.  Such a  function  must be tractable to  com pute 
                        in  the forward  direction,  but  com putationally  in feasible  to 
                        invert.   <b>This  protocol  leverages  a  user's  cell  phone  and 
                            short message service to  thwart  password hacking. </b>

                    <p class="p1"> Generally,  password-based  user  authentication  can  resist 
                        brute  force  and  dictionary  attacks  [10],  [18]  if  users 
                        select  strong  passwords  to  provide  sufficient  entropy. 
                        However,  password-based  user  authentication  has  a  major 
                        problem  that  humans  are  not  experts  in  memorizing  text 
                        strings[3]. Thus, most  users  would  choose  easy-to-remember 
                        passwords  [13].  Figure  1  shows  the  analysis  of  password 
                        selection  by  user.  Another  problem  is  that  users  tend  to 
                        reuse  passwords  across  various  websites.  Password  reuse 
                        causes  users  to  lose  sensitive  information  stored  in  different 
                        websites  if  a  hacker  compromises  one  of  their  passwords 
                        [14].  The  above  problems  are  caused  by  the  negative 
                        influence  of  human  factors.  <b>Therefore,  it  is  important  to 
                        978-1-4673-4603-0/12/$31.00  ©2012 IEEE  </b>
                        take  human  factors  into  consideration  when  designing  a 
                        hacking  resistance  protocol.  Up  to  now,  researchers  have 
                        investigated  a  variety  of  technology  to  reduce  the  negative 
                        influence  of  human  factors  in  the  user  authentication 
                        procedure.  Since  humans  are  more  adept  in  remembering 
                        graphical  passwords  [15],  [1]  many  graphical  password 
                        schemes  were  designed  to  address  human's  password 
                        recall  problem.  Using  password  management  tools  is  an 
                        alternative.  These  tools  automatically  generate  strong 
                        passwords  for  each  website,  which  addresses  password 
                        reuse  and  password recall problems.  The  advantage  is  that 
                        users only  have  to  remember  a  master  password  to  access 
                        the  management  tool.  Despite  the  assistance  of  these  two 
                        technologies- graphical  password  [8]  and  password 
                        management  tool  the  user  authentication  system  still 
                        suffers  from  some  considerable drawbacks.  </p>
